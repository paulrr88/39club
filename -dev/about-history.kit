<!--$page-title About Us &mdash; History-->
<!--$description We were founded in 1958 by Mr. and Mrs. Skinner, who ran the initial club in an old building which they rebuilt, along with an annexe on the side, which is where we operate today. It is said that the club was named the 39 Club because the ages of those using it ranged from 3 to 90. Other stories say it was started in a house numbered no. 39, possibly in Den Avenue!-->
